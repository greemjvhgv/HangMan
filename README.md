## About

HangMan is a classic word-guessing game where the player must guess a hidden word one letter at a time before running out of tries. The game features a custom ASCII art title screen, colour-coded feedback, and a play-again loop so you can keep going without restarting the application.

## Features

- Three difficulty modes:
  - Easy — 4 to 5 letter words (6 tries)
  - Medium — 6 to 7 letter words (6 tries)
  - Hard — 8 to 9 letter words (6 tries)
- Input validation — rejects non-alphabetic characters and duplicate guesses
- Colour-coded terminal feedback (green for wins, red for losses and wrong guesses)
- ASCII art title banner on startup
- Play-again loop after each round

## How to Play

1. Launch the game and choose a difficulty mode
2. A hidden word is displayed as underscores (e.g. `_ _ _ _ _`)
3. Type a single letter and press Enter to guess
4. Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word
5. Incorrect guesses reduce your remaining tries
6. Win by guessing the full word before your tries run out

## What I Learned

- Structuring a C# console application using classes and static methods
- Using `Regex` for input validation to ensure only single a–z characters are accepted
- Managing game state with loops and lists to track guessed letters
- Using `Console.ForegroundColor` to create a more engaging terminal UI
- Implementing a play-again loop using a `do-while` construct
